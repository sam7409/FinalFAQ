# Can I transfer my subscription to another Apple ID?

## Currently, transfering subscriptions across different Apple IDs is not possible.
Each subscription is linked to a specific account. However, you can cancel your ongoing subscription and re-subscribe using your new Apple ID. we recommend you to refer this Apple official guide on How To Cancel Subcription plan - Apple [How To Cancel Subcription plan - Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039)
